This project is from The Odin Project, and is meant to not only test what I have learned so far in the course, but to also push me past what I know.
I anticipate this challenge to take me the better part of this week, but I am hoping to use techniques I've learned from watching programs such as CS50, and some of the coding tutorials I have already watched.
I will update the readme as we go!
