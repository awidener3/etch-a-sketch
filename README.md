This project is from The Odin Project, and is meant to not only test what I have learned so far in the course, but to also push me past what I know.

I anticipate this challenge to take me the better part of this week, but I am hoping to use techniques I've learned from watching programs such as CS50, and some of the coding tutorials I have already watched.

I will update the readme as we go!

This project was way more fun than I anticipated! There's some functionality that I haven't implemented, mainly the ability to click then drag to draw on the etch-a-sketch, but I hope to return to this either in a few months or after the bootcamp I am attending in December.
